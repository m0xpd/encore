This repository describes a delay module, developed for electronic synthesisers, in Eurorack format, based on the[LF398](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lf398-n)) device. 


**Functional Description**

A block diagram of  S&H  is shown below:



**Licensing**

S&H is published under a Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 [License](https://github.com/m0xpd/encore/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

**Implementation**

The system is implemented on a single PCB.

The schematic for the PCB is linked by the graphic below below (click for the full-size schematic):


You will find full details of the two printed circuit boards (in files for the Eagle Layout Editor) [here](https://github.com/m0xpd/encore/tree/main/PCBs) and 
a Kicad project defining a front panel [here](https://github.com/m0xpd/encore/tree/main/FrontPanel).

**Specifications**

S&H  is 6HP wide and extends xxmm behind the front panel (when a standard Eurorack power header is inserted).

S&H draws xx mA from the +12V supply and xx mA from the -12V supply.
