# Front Panel

This folder contains a simple Kicad project to create a front panel for the encore! delay module.

The panel you see above was manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (usual disclaimer) directly from the Gerbers generated by my design files.
It is aluminium and I specified black PCB, with white top screen (for the lettering). Other lines and annotation on the front 
are on the front mask layer.

There is a small text area on the bottom screen (the 'back' of the panel), which - importantly - includes a locator for the order 
number. Remember to select 'specify position' for the order number if you order from JLCPCB, otherwise they might place a meaningless 
number right over the front of your nice panel!
